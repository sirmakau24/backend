## Manifesto

How many of us believe itâ€™s time for Africa to rise and claim true independence? Af-Text is our first step: a chat platform built **for Africa, by Africans**, prioritizing privacy, openness, and community ownership. This project is intentionally simple to start, and intentionally built to be forked, self-hosted, and extended.

---

## Features

- Username / email / phone signup (configurable)
- JWT authentication
- Real-time 1:1 messaging (Socket.IO)
- Message persistence (MongoDB)
- Typing indicators & read receipts (MVP hooks)
- Simple image attachments (dev: local; prod: S3/MinIO)
- Admin moderation endpoints (basic)
- Self-hostable, modular, and extensible

---

## Tech stack (recommended)

- Frontend: React (Vite) + plain CSS
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Real-time: Socket.IO
- Database: MongoDB (Atlas free tier or self-hosted)
- File storage: Local (dev) / MinIO or S3-compatible (prod)
- Dev & infra: Docker, docker-compose, nginx (reverse proxy)

> Prioritize free or low-cost tiers and OSS tooling to keep deployments accessible to communities.

## Quick start (local development)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (16+ recommended)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB (local or Atlas) â€” for quick start use local Docker or a local install
- Optional: Docker & docker-compose (for single-command local infra)


### Backend setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
# create .env (see "Environment variables" below)
npm run dev # assumes nodemon; or node src/server.js
```

Minimal server commands used in examples:

- `npm start` â€” production start
- `npm run dev` â€” development start (nodemon)

### Frontend setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev # vite dev server
# open the printed URL (usually http://localhost:5173)
```

âœ… Local dev checklist

- [ ] MongoDB service is running (or MONGO_URI points to Atlas)
- [ ] Backend `.env` present and not committed
- [ ] Frontend CORS or proxy configured to call backend
- [ ] Socket.IO client connects to the backend URL

---

## Environment variables

Create a `.env` file in `backend/` with at least the following:

```
PORT=4000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/aftext
JWT_SECRET=replace_with_a_strong_secret
UPLOAD_DIR=./uploads
```

- In production, set `JWT_SECRET` from a secure source and do not commit `.env` files to git.

---

## API examples

### Register

`POST /api/auth/register`

Body:

```json
{
  "username": "alice",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "password": "strongpassword"
}
```

Response (example):

```json
{
  "user": { "_id": "...", "username": "alice" },
  "token": "<jwt>"
}
```

### Login

`POST /api/auth/login`

Body: `{ username, password }` â†’ Response: `{ user, token }`.

### Get messages for a room

`GET /api/messages/:room` â€” Requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header

---

## Socket.IO events

**Client -> Server**

- `join` { room }
- `send-message` { room, from, content }

**Server -> Client**

- `receive-message` { room, from, content, createdAt }
- `user-typing` { room, userId }

---

## E2EE: short note and next steps

**Important:** The code in this repo implements server-side messaging and transport security (HTTPS/TLS) patterns. This is *not* full end-to-end encryption (E2EE).

If you want E2EE, implement these steps in a separate branch as a prototype:

1. Generate client-side asymmetric keys (per user/device) and never send private keys to the server.
2. Use established cryptographic libraries (libsodium, WebCrypto) and avoid custom crypto.
3. Use a secure key-exchange (e.g., X3DH / Double Ratchet) for forward secrecy.
4. Store only public keys on the server; messages are encrypted on sender client and decrypted on recipient client.
5. Audit and peer-review before shipping. Consider using existing audited libraries/protocols.

---

## Security & best practices

- Hash passwords with bcrypt or argon2 â€” never store plaintext.
- Use HTTPS in production; front the app with Nginx or a managed TLS provider.
- Use express-rate-limit for auth endpoints to block brute-force attempts.
- Validate and sanitize all inputs; use mongoose validation and server-side checks.
- Limit file upload sizes and validate MIME types for images.
- Use CORS configured to trusted origins in production.
- Use JWT short expiry and refresh tokens for long sessions.

---

## Common bugs & troubleshooting checklist

- Socket events fire twice after reconnection: ensure event listeners are removed on component unmount and on socket reconnect.
- CORS errors on frontend requests: verify backend `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` and Vite proxy settings.
- Messages not persisted but shown in UI: make sure the server saves the message **before** emitting to clients. Use transactions if needed.
- Images not loading in prod: check storage path and signed URLs; remember ephemeral containers lose local storage.
- Timezone issues: store `createdAt` in UTC and convert on the client.

---

## Deployment tips

1. Use Docker for reproducible deployments and docker-compose for local infra (Mongo, MinIO).
2. For Socket.IO scaling across multiple instances use the Redis adapter (`socket.io-redis`) and a sticky-session load balancer (or use a message broker).
3. Use S3/MinIO for persistent file storage (avoid local disk on ephemeral hosts).
4. Configure health checks, logging, and monitoring (simple: Winston + log rotation).
5. Back up MongoDB data regularly (Atlas or pg_dump-equivalent for your DB).

## Contribution guide

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch: `feat/your-feature`
3. Write tests for new features where applicable
4. Open a pull request with a clear description and screenshots where helpful

Coding style quick notes:

- Keep React components small and focused
- Prefer simple, readable code over clever one-liners
- Document API changes in the README and update postman / Insomnia collections
